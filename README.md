## Hi there, I am Daniel Gonzalez ðŸ‘‹
I am a computer science student at Universidad del Valle in Guatemala, passionate about programming, artificial intelligence and software architecture. I have worked in plenty
academic projects and I am currently looking to take some real world challenges to apply my knowledge and learn even more.

<h2>My Skills:</h2>

Through different projects and my curiosity, I have acquired experience and knowledge in different tools. I like to give 110% in everything I do, taking my learning further.
I have a good level of python, by creating different projects with it, including a compiler. Furthermore, I have done multiple machine learning projects, which have taught me
about different methods to approach data driven problems. Here are a few of the tools I currently know:

<h2>Projects</h2>

<h3>Web</h3>

- [Netflix-like app Repo](https://github.com/Daniel14gonc/api-streaming.git): I built a web application to mimic the way Netflix works in terms of user managment, which included creating accounts and profiles.
  Each profile had a list of liked movies, watched movies and basic recommendations. It was done using Flask, PostgreSQL and React.
- [Twitter-like app](https://github.com/Daniel14gonc/Proyecto1_BD2_API.git): I built a Twitter clone with different features. The frontend was made with React and the backend with flask and mongodb. It has many features, including account creation, tweet
  posting, a time line, comments and likes.

<h3>Machine Learning and AI</h3>

- [Minmax Othello](https://github.com/Aristondo01/Reversi_IA.git): I made a minmax algorithm such that an agent could play othello. It went really good, because we won the tournament held at our Artificial Intelligence course in college.
  It beat level 17 out of 30 of the game app [The Othello](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.co.unbalance.android.othello_free&hl=en_US).
